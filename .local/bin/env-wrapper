# This script is just workaround for xdg desktop entries, because:
# 1. Desktop files can't work with environment
# 2. Quotes completely broken, I haven't found any way to use them
# 3. I spend too much time trying to make it in desktop file

# Usage:   env-wrapper COMMAND arguments...
# Example: env-wrapper EDITOR ~/.profile
